                                If you find that you have no heating and hot water the issue is likely to be connected to the boiler. 
                                Sometimes a boiler will have a fault and will require resetting. You can do this by turning it off and back on again.
                                 Some heating and hot water systems controlled by a timer or thermostat which is found on a control unit on the wall.
                                  Make sure that the timer is set to ‘on’ and that the thermostat is set to the desired temperature.
                                   If you have had to turn the switch to ‘on’ or turn the the heating up, it may take some time to reach the desired temperature.
                                    If the timer is set so that heating and hot water is ‘off’ at the time you wish to use it, you may be able to get a supply for one hour by pressing the ‘heating advance’ or ‘hot water advance’ buttons.
                                     If your boiler has lost pressure you will see the pressure gauge on ‘0’. You may need to add pressure using the filling loop. Once the pressure is at the correct level you will need to turn off the filling loop.
                                      If you have a top-up electricity or gas meter, you may have run out of credit for it and require a top-up. If after following the above steps you still have a problem, please call our maintenance helpdesk on <span>0333 366 1159</span>

                           The fuse box (also called the consumer unit) contains the main on/off switch for the electricity in your home. The fuse box can usually be found next to the electricity meter, under your stairs or by your front door.
                            It has a circuit breaker that will automatically switch off the electricity by tripping a switch, breaking the circuit in the event of an electrical fault.
                             You will also find a row of smaller switches called mini circuit breakers, or RCDs. These control the electricity to the lighting and socket circuits in particular rooms or parts of your home.
                              They will trip out if there is an overload on a particular circuit (e.g. if a light bulb blows or too many electrical items are plugged into one socket). Loss of electricity could be because of a power cut or,
                               if you have a top up electric key meter, a lack of credit. Check to see if neighbours’ homes have also been affected by a potential power cut. If neighbours still have power, you may have to check whether 
                               a fuse has tripped in your fuse box.

                            Water leaks can occur for a number of reasons, including damage to pipework or roofing, a fault developing with an appliance that uses water,
                             and sanitary items overflowing – like baths, showers, sinks and toilets. In the event of a leak it is important that you identify what is leaking 
                             and make sure the water is turned off to stop the leak from getting worse. If you notice a water leak please turn off the water at the stopcock 
                             and place a container underneath the source to avoid further damage. Any water leaks should be reported to Creating Change immediately to 0333 366 1159.
                              When bathing please make sure shower or bath mats are in use to catch escaping water, and ensure that the bath is not filled so high that it overflows. After bathing,
                             be sure to check the floor for excess water and mop up any spills if necessary to prevent water from getting to places it isn’t supposed to be.

                                        Regular buildups of condensation can allow a fungus known as ‘black mould’ to grow on walls, ceilings, clothes and furniture. As well as affecting plasterwork and rotting window frames, black mould can have a negative effect on your health 
                                        if the mould is not treated promptly. Mould can be a particular problem in the colder months when residents will often keep windows closed and clothes will be dried inside the home. To prevent condensation and 
                                        mould you should maintain a constant balance of warmth and ventilation in your home. Mould can be treated very easily by wiping off as much as is possible using a fungicidal wash, ensuring the instructions are being closely followed.
                                        Fungicidal wash can be bought from most supermarkets and hardware stores. Repaint the affected surface using a fungicidal paint and dry any wet surfaces, such as windows and windowsills daily to help prevent the mould returning.
                                        Windows should be left partially open to allow for adequate ventilation.
                                        To avoid the buildup of condensation and the growth of mould in your home.
                                </p>
                                <p> try following these six simple steps: </p>
                                <ul class="list-decimal px-8">
                                    <li> Produce less moisture</li>

                                    <li> Open the Windows</li>

                                    <li> Kill and remove the mould </li>

                                    Residents have a responsibility to ensure their home is adequately ventilated to avoid mould growth.
                                        Instances of mould should be reported as soon as they are identified in order for advice to be given. Please take extra precautions against condensation and mould during the winter months.
                                        If you have identified mould please report it to Creating Change by calling 0333 366 1159

                    <p class="md:px-16 px-5 py-10"> Intensive Housing Management is a term used to describe the services provided by a supported housing landlord. The services are provided to ensure the ongoing viability of the tenancy with respect to the needs of the residents.

                    </p>

It can also include services which are additional to the services an ordinary landlord might provide, such as provision of repairs and maintenance that resident might be expected to do in a general needs license, adaptations made to the property to ensure its suitability, provision of accessible materials if needed based on professional healthcare needs assessment, 24/7 emergency contact details provided, increased number of inspections and property visits, and ongoing liaison with other parties involved in the provision of services to the resident.</p>

                    <p class="mt-10"> All of Creating Change's residents have access to the same Intensive Housing Management services provided by Creating Change.
This section provides more detailed information about the types of Intensive Housing Management services provided by Creating Change.</p>
